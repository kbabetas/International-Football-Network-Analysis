# International-Football-Network-Analysis

This repository will serve as a place where the project from the course **Social Networks Analysis** will be uploaded. The course is part of the curriculum of the Department of Management Science and Technology from the Athens University of Economics and Business and the project is assigned by [Dimitrios Pournarakis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/demitrios-pournarakis-71b59223/).

## Dataset

The Dataset that was selected for the Network Analysis is the International football results from 1872 to 2019 which was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017).

The Dataset includes 41.540 results from the national football teams starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2019. The matches are strictly men’s full internationals and they do not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation’s B Team, Under-23 or a league selected team.
